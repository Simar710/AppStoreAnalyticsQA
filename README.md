# AppStoreAnalytics
SwiftUI-based iOS app that simulates an App Store Analytics dashboard. It fetches analytic metrics (such as downloads, active users, etc.) from a REST API endpoint and displays them in a list. The project is built to show:

- **iOS Client Development:** Modern Swift and SwiftUI usage, networking with URLSession, and error handling.
- **Backend Integration:** Communication with a REST API (which you can simulate or point to a test server).
Test Automation:
- **Unit Tests:** Validating JSON decoding and model integrity.
- **UI Tests:** Ensuring the dashboard loads and displays data correctly.
- **REST API Tests:** A Python script to test API endpoints (demonstrating multi-language automation skills).
